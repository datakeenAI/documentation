      summary: Information extraction from identity cards
      description: |
        This synchronous API processes and controls official French ID documents:
          * National ID Cards (2003 or 2021 model)
          * Biometric Passports
          * Living Permits (2011 or 2021 model)
          * Driver License (2013 model)

        The API extract in real-time relevant information and control information.

          * Global Status - is the identity card a real valid card: true or false
          * Are the initials are present on the photo
          * Is the MRZ stripe conform regarding other extracted information
          * Is the MRZ stripe valid regarding other extracted information
          * Is the photo present
          * Are holographic symbols present

        User input controls (verify if the expected information matches the extractions):
          * first name
          * last name
          * birth date
          * gender
          * photo: The photo must be in portrait format and the face must be visible and not covered.

        Information extracted cover:
          * Card holder's first name
          * Card holder's last name
          * Card holder's birth date
          * Card holder's birth place
          * Card holder's address
          * Card delivery date
          * Card expiry date
          * Card Id Number
          * Card MRZ 

        The API accepts images or pdfs. Only one format is accepted at a time.
        The API accepts the front and back on the same file or on two separate files (either 2 images or 2 pdf pages). A maximum of 2 pages is allowed.


        For better results, it is highly recommended to provide documents under these properties:

          * The image resolution should be greater than 200 DPI
          * The document must not be blurred or rotated
          * In case of a photo document, make sure that the text area does not contain any highlights or shadows
          * The entire document must be in the frame

        Please note the following rate limits are applied :
          * Maximum file size: 5 MB.
          * Maximum number of calls per minute: 10 calls.
